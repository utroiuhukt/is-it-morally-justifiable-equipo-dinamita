## Activity: the Darknet

## What is the Darknet?
## The Darknet is a hidden part of the internet that can only be accessed with special software, like Tor, which allows anonymity. Although it is not illegal itself, its anonymous nature makes it attractive for illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, weapons, or stolen information. However, it is also used by people who want privacy, like journalists, activists, or political dissidents in oppressive regimes.

## Is it morally acceptable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?
## It is not morally acceptable to use individuals as tools, even if they are criminals. This violates the principle of human dignity, which says that all people should be treated as ends in themselves, not as means. Even though criminals must be held accountable for their actions, their humanity and basic rights should be respected.

## Does working with the justice system make up for the crimes he committed?
## Working with the justice system can be a mitigating factor, but it does not necessarily make up for the crimes committed. Cooperation can show regret and a willingness to fix mistakes, but it does not erase the harm caused. It is interesting how Sam Bent helped the authorities, which might reflect an attempt to make up for his actions. However, justice must balance rehabilitation with accountability for illegal actions.

## Choose one of the measures he took to protect himself. Which principle did he violate?
## Sam Bent used cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to receive payments and launder money. By doing this, he violated the principle of legality, as his actions were meant to evade the law and facilitate illegal activities. Even though cryptocurrencies are legitimate tools, using them for illegal purposes is a violation of social and legal norms.

## If you had the chance to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?
## I would ask him: What led you to get involved in drug trafficking on the Darknet, and what do you think we can learn from your experience?
